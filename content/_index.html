government content is the same as good content anywhere else: it is easy
to understand, and it helps users do what they want to do.</p>

informational tone.</p>

<p>To this end, we’ve structured the guide into descriptively named
sections. Find the topic you’re looking for in our table of contents, or
search by keyword. We aren’t opposed if you’d like to read this guide
start to finish, of course.</p>

organizational needs. This guide is just that: a guide. It’s not meant
to provide the final opinion on any of the topics discussed. If a
certain section isn’t relevant to you and your team, delete it. And if
you feel the guide is missing a section, by all means, add it. This
guide is yours to use, and we trust you’ll update it in the ways that
best suit you.</p>
